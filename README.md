# Simple Blockchain Simulation

## Overview
This project is a basic blockchain simulation implemented in Python. It demonstrates how blocks are linked using cryptographic hashes, includes a simple proof-of-work mechanism, and allows tampering detection.

## Features
- Block structure with index, timestamp, transactions, previous hash, and current hash.
- SHA-256 hashing for block integrity.
- Blockchain class for managing blocks.
- Simple proof-of-work.
- Chain validation to detect tampering.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

## Installation & Execution
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Ishank543/Blockchain-simulation.git
   cd simple-blockchain
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Expected Output
The script prints the details of each block and validates the blockchain before and after tampering.
